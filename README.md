# enrem_plant_tradeoffs

These data sets and scripts were used to test predictions about the role of defense trade-offs with competition and growth in diversity maintenance by tracking plant speciesâ€™ abundances in a field experiment that removed individual consumer groups (mammals, arthropods, fungi) and added nutrients. 

Here you will find the datasets (plant biomass, plant species lists) as well as R code to reproduce analysis published in Zaret et al. 2024. Plant growth-defense trade-offs are general across interactions with fungal, insect, and mammalian consumers. Ecology
